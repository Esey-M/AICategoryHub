                </section>

                <section class="mb-10">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Core Technologies and Components</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Voice assistants rely on several key technologies working together seamlessly:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">ASR technology converts spoken language into text, enabling machines to understand human speech. Modern ASR systems use deep learning to recognize speech patterns with remarkable accuracy, even in noisy environments or with different accents. This technology has improved dramatically in recent years, with error rates dropping below 5% for many languages.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">NLU processes the text produced by ASR to extract meaning, intent, and context. Beyond simply recognizing words, NLU determines what users want to accomplish, identifies key entities in the request, and understands the nuances of human language. Advanced NLU models can handle ambiguity, colloquialisms, and complex queries with increasing sophistication.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Dialog Management</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Dialog management systems track conversation state and determine appropriate responses. They maintain context across multiple turns of conversation, handle clarifications, and manage the flow of interaction. Modern systems can maintain coherent conversations over several exchanges, remember prior context, and adapt to user preferences.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Text-to-Speech (TTS)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">TTS converts text responses into natural-sounding speech. Recent advances in neural TTS have produced voices that closely mimic human speech patterns, complete with natural intonation, emphasis, and pacing. Many systems now offer multiple voices with different characteristics and can be customized for specific brands or use cases.</p>
