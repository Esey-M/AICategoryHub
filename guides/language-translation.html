            </section>

            <section class="guide-section">
                <h2>Evolution of Translation Technology</h2>
                
                <h3>Rule-Based Machine Translation</h3>
                <p>Early translation systems relied on linguistic rules and dictionaries programmed by human experts. These systems followed grammar patterns and vocabulary mappings between languages, but struggled with exceptions, idiomatic expressions, and ambiguity. While effective for highly structured content in specific domains, rule-based approaches required extensive manual development for each language pair.</p>
                
                <h3>Statistical Machine Translation</h3>
                <p>Statistical approaches analyze millions of translated texts to identify patterns and probabilities of word sequences. By learning from existing human translations, these systems could handle more natural language and varied content than rule-based systems. However, they still faced challenges with languages having limited parallel corpora and often produced grammatically incorrect or contextually inappropriate translations.</p>
                
                <h3>Neural Machine Translation</h3>
                <p>The current state-of-the-art in translation technology, neural machine translation (NMT) uses deep learning to understand and generate language. These systems process entire sentences to capture context and relationships between words, resulting in more fluent and natural-sounding translations. Advanced NMT models like Transformer-based architectures have dramatically improved translation quality across diverse languages and domains.</p>
                
                <h3>Hybrid and Specialized Approaches</h3>
                <p>Many modern translation systems combine multiple approachesâ€”neural networks for fluency and context, rule-based components for specialized terminology, and statistical methods for refinement. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for medical, legal, technical, or other specialized content provide higher accuracy for professional applications where precision is critical.</p>
