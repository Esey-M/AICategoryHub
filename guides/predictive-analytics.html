                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Balance Model Complexity</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    More complex models aren't always better. While sophisticated deep learning approaches can capture intricate patterns, they may also require more data, computational resources, and expertise. Choose model complexity based on your specific needs, data availability, and the importance of model explainability.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Validate and Test Thoroughly</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Use rigorous validation techniques like cross-validation and holdout testing to assess model performance. Test predictions against actual outcomes regularly, and establish processes for monitoring model drift over time to ensure continued accuracy as conditions change.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Prioritize Interpretability</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In many business contexts, understanding why a prediction was made is as important as the prediction itself. When possible, use interpretable models or explainable AI techniques that can provide insights into which factors are driving predictions and how they're weighted.
