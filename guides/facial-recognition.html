                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Core Computer Vision Technologies</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">1. Image Classification</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Image classification involves categorizing entire images into predefined classes based on their visual content. Modern classification algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can identify thousands of object categories with accuracy that sometimes exceeds human performance. Applications range from content categorization and photo organization to quality control in manufacturing and medical image analysis.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">2. Object Detection</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Object detection goes beyond classification by identifying multiple objects within an image and localizing them with bounding boxes. Advanced architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once), R-CNN (Region-based CNN), and SSD (Single Shot Detector) enable real-time object detection with high precision. This capability powers applications like autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and retail analytics.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">3. Semantic Segmentation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Semantic segmentation classifies each pixel in an image, providing a more detailed understanding of visual scenes than object detection. This technology enables precise delineation of object boundaries and is essential for applications requiring fine-grained image understanding, such as medical imaging, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality experiences.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">4. Instance Segmentation</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Instance segmentation combines object detection with semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects while precisely outlining their boundaries. This sophisticated approach enables applications to distinguish between multiple instances of the same object category, critical for scenarios like crowd analysis, industrial inspection, and robotics.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Facial Recognition Technology</h2>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Face Detection</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Face detection is the foundational step in facial recognition systems, identifying the presence and location of human faces within images or video streams. Modern face detection algorithms can identify faces regardless of orientation, lighting conditions, or partial obstructions. This technology powers features like autofocus in cameras, automated photo tagging, and the initial stage of biometric authentication systems.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Facial Feature Extraction</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Once faces are detected, facial feature extraction identifies key facial landmarks and characteristics like the distance between eyes, nose shape, jawline contours, and hundreds of other measurements. These biometric features are converted into numerical representations (facial embeddings or faceprints) that serve as unique identifiers for individual faces, enabling comparison and matching.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Face Matching & Identification</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Face matching compares extracted facial features against a database of known faces to identify individuals. This process can operate in verification mode (confirming a claimed identity through 1:1 matching) or identification mode (determining an unknown identity through 1:N matching). The matching process employs sophisticated similarity metrics and machine learning to achieve high accuracy even with varying expressions, aging, or appearance changes.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Facial Analysis & Attribute Recognition</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Beyond identification, advanced facial analysis can determine attributes like age, gender, emotional state, gaze direction, and attention levels. These capabilities enable applications ranging from audience analytics and adaptive user interfaces to security threat assessment and healthcare monitoring. Emotion recognition, while still evolving, shows promise for applications in market research, mental health monitoring, and enhanced human-computer interaction.
